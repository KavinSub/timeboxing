# Timeboxing

Timeboxing is a great way of breaking your work up into manageable chunks. The key idea is you work non-stop for some time (be it 5 minutes, or 2 hours), followed by a short break. Rinse and repeat.

I wanted to build an app that keeps track of these timeboxes for you, and displays this data in a visual manner. These timeboxes are only accounted for if the timer runs to completion. The app works fine in Chrome and Firefox. Unfortunately, not in Safari.

### The Calendar
For every 30 minutes you work, the calendar will add a red dot.

### The Bubble Chart
Every time you complete a timebox, the relative frequences are computed and displayed here. You'll get a better idea of when you're most productive.
